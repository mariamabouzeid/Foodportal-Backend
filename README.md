## How to run? ##

1. Open a terminal (linux) or command line (windows) in the project's root directory
2. Run the command "mvn clean install". This builds the project to the directory "target"
3. In target directory, you can find two files, java-ee-base.war and java-ee-base-swarm.jar
4. From the project's root directory again, run the command "java -jar target/java-ee-base-swarm.jar". This starts the Swarm server instance and deploys your application to it
5. Your application will run locally and use the port 8880
